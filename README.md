### GG!

This gem will include both esdb and ggtracker API implementations. We could separate the two, but for now we'll keep it inside a single gem and see if it's beneficial to separate it later on.

(And even though it's unlikely we will have the gem around in esdb, I might want to not use the ESDB namespace ..)
